# This is the code for "Data Imbalance Handling and Cross-Country Generalization in Predictive Modeling of Low Birth Weight" project.

Infants with low birth weight (LBW < 2500g) face a significant risk of mortality and disability. Predictive modeling can be beneficial in identifying expectant mothers who have a high risk of delivering LBW infants. This study handled data imbalance problem and focused on predictive model construction, achieving the best AUC as 0.7756 in data from Ethiopia. It also extended the scope of analysis to Guinea to measure out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization regarding LBW data.
